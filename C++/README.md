# C++ Codes for PAS and Baselines

## Platform
On the CPU platform, the codes of PAS and the baselines are compiled using g++ version 9.4.0 (Ubuntu 9.4.0-1ubuntu1~20.04.1) and run on a server equipped with two Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6258R 2.70GHz CPUs and 754GB RAM.

## Requirements
- cmake >= 3.10
- g++

## Descriptions
We evaluate the performance of our proposal and compared it with state-of-the-art algorithms. The compiling command is as follows.

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
```
